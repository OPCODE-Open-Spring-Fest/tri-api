# Project Tour

## tri-api

Multi-API Data Display is an open-source web application that fetches information from three different APIs and displays the data on separate pages. Each API provides unique data sets, allowing users to explore diverse content within the same application.


## Features

- Feature 1: An IMDB API, where one can fetch all data about entertainment.
- Feature 2: A Cars API, where one can fetch all data about cars and its functioning.
- Feature 3: A Currency API, where one can convert one currency to another.

## Folder Structure
- 1: The component folder would contain all the different user made components.
- 2: All folders other than the Home and Navbar would contain a file, where one would use the 'axios.create()' method on the API and export it to the other folder, where it would be fetched.
- 3: The home page folder would contain the home page component.
- 4: The navbar folder would contain the navbar component.
- 5: Note that strongly recommend the contributor to make more files in these folders and use atomic component to 'increase code readability'.
- 6: Note that the contributor should use 'axios.create()' to fetch the API as it would be more suitable in fetching the given API.
